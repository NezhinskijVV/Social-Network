prop.style.dancehall.text=Dancehall (dancehall) - street Jamaican dance, relatively young, but already conquered the countries of Europe, Asia and America. Dancehall means not only a style of music or a place. It is a whole culture that unites music, dance, society and politics. In Jamaica, dancehall dances all, but the specificity of the execution of certain movements in women and men is different. At the heart of the style is a special, relaxed quality, and at the same time full control over your body, as well as various techniques and dynamics of movement of the hips (wine, booty shake). And of course the unique Jamaican dancehall vibes!
prop.style.dancehall.history=History
prop.style.dancehall.text2=Initially, dancehall is a musical style that arose in Jamaica in the late 70s. This music absorbed the reggae melodies known to most of the bean gauze compositions with the addition of modern arrangements. The peculiarity of dancehall is a very specific manner of execution as well as riddims. Riddim is a producer-created beat, to which several artists record their tracks, all of which are produced by a single disc with a common name. (E.g., Love and Peace Riddim). The abbreviated name raggamuffin (reading) - ragga - was the reason that in Europe, and then in Russia, ragga was called the dance, which is performed under this music. Dancehall (literally, the dance hall) owes its name to space spaces in which the local people dashingly dance to popular Jamaican records broadcast by local sound systems. Dance floors (dance halls) can be found not only in the most urbanized areas of Jamaica, for example in Kingston, but also in less populated regions.

prop.style.electro.history=History
prop.style.electro.text1=Electro dance is a street dance that arose in the early 2000s in the wake of the popularity of nightclubs under the influence of Belgian club dances. The dance was quickly popularized through video clips posted on social networking sites and video hosting sites. The name was chosen because it's the first dance that dances exclusively to the music of the electro house.
prop.style.electro.etimology=Etymology
prop.style.electro.text2=The absence of the original name for the dance and the simultaneous popularization of the "Tecktonik Killer" parties organized by the Metropolis Club led to the emergence of the brand (trademark) "Tecktonik" on the wave of electro dance, which later became known as the dance itself, and Clothes. Movement pioneers and leading dancers prefer to use the term "Tecktonik" for the brand name, and "electro dance" is for the dance itself: Tecktonik is a clothing brand, the media use this word for the name of the dance, but they have nothing in common. The dance is called Electro Dance. The founder of the Milky Way subtype also negatively refers to the use of the term "tectonics": Do not say "Tecktonik"! This brand uses dance to make money. My dance is not "Tecktonik", but you can call it "Electro Dance" and "Milky Way". Please forward this message all over the world! Another step, a dance is born, not a brand ... The same view is shared by other leading dancers: The dance is called electro. And point. Tecktonik is a brand, a brand, this is the name of the company. If people search the Internet electro, typing in the search bar "Tectonics", then they do not understand anything. This word is the name of the company. To say "I'm dancing the Tecktonik" for an electro dancer is the same as if a hip-hop style dancer said "I'm dancing Kit-Kat" or "I'm dancing Nike".

prop.style.hiphop.text1=Hip Hop appeared in the Southern Bronx in 1973.
prop.style.hiphop.oldschool=Hip-Hop Dance - Old School
prop.style.hiphop.buddha=Buddha Stretch
prop.style.hiphop.text2=We will discuss the origins of Hip Hop Culture and Hip-hop Dance. Hip Hop Culture began in the South Bronx around 1973 (South Bronx, 1973, at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue (Sedgwick & Cesar), and came after the culture of black and Latin Americans of the 60s and 70s .Hip-hop as a dance came from the same Culture from the 70s, before they even really became known as hip-hop, just in every part of the city there was an expression and a look at Hip Hop Culture, in the Bronx was 'Bboying or Breaking', 'Emsy' (Mc) And DJs, but in Brooklyn we had a so-called Freakstyle style, well, you know, it was bboying in the Bronx, but it was called freestyle, and the Bronx also had Rocking, , And in Brooklyn's Brooklyn Rock (Brooklyn Rock), and all this gave direction to the culture, and Hip Hop became the mainstream direction (main direction), and hip-hop dance came from Hip Hop Culture, after the films "Beat Street" (Beat Street, Breaking, Breaking - Electric Boogaloo, etc., after the show and advertising, the dance aspect, namely Biboing, Popping and Locking came to naught, played its way. What happened? It happened that many dancers, poppers, lockers and others began to mix all the styles together, and the bboys began to call it Freestyle, and we just called it hip-hop, and the reason for this was that all we did was , We did the hip-hop music, which separated the hip-hop dance from bboying, which was danced to a musical break that came from funk music, rock music, salsa music and so on. But hip-hop, everyone started to dance 'The Wop' (The Whop) because he played the track 'B-Fats - Do The Whop'. We did Happy Feet under Doug E. Fresh - The Show, did the movement James Brown, under the Super La Cue Du James ( Super Lover Cee- Do The James), because there was sung 'Do The James Brown'.
prop.style.hiphop.henry=Henry Link
prop.style.hiphop.text3=At the heart it has the track and dance to a particular song, and when the track is playing, you danced these movements rather than any others. Only this dance (movement). And then everything is danced different movements, different variations, but when play a track, the people who knew all about it, this dance machine.
prop.style.hiphop.text4=Many dancers came from popping, breaking, and they took these elements and made a mix of 'Dance Dance' (Social Dance) with these styles, and this turned out to be a hip-hop dance. We came together, we took everything we did, it was a mix of all the styles, that's how the hip-hop dance appeared. The same story and with House Dance, House Culture came from Disco (Disco), as a kind of early hip-hop. That's why everyone calls the style that we do freestyle, because it's a mix, but in all styles, it's basically the same thing, because they came from the syllables, before the styles appeared. In the late 80s, when the 'Bit Street Era' died and the hip-hop era began, and in the 90's, when it reached a maximum of popularity not only national, but also international, and still. The music changed and the dance with it. I think people just forgot where this story started, we started it with music and because of the love of music, and it seems to me it was lost, it's a form of art and people should treat it like that.

prop.style.hiphop.middleschool=Hip-Hop Dance - Middle School
prop.style.hiphop.text5=Now we are going to discuss the hip-hop direction during the period of time as 'Middle School' (Middle School). Some say from 90-91, until about 1997, something like that. In the early 90s and the mid-90's there was a video period (Video Age) - because the dancers were in almost all the videos and hip-hop took the main position, it was everywhere, everywhere and everyone saw it. I like to call the 'middle cheekbones' video a century. Because before that there were videos, but there were few where the dancers met, and during this period, all the videos were with the participation of dancers. Early 90s, I like to call the 'Das EFX' era, because at that time many had drids, and 'Das Effects' were so popular that if suddenly someone saw a guy with dreads, they immediately remembered this group. I like to think about those times, like Timberland's time. Because everyone started wearing Timberland, Cross Colors, Karl Kani, wearing huge sweaters and hoodles, wearing hoodies on baseball caps. For example, as in the video 'TI C' - 'Hat To Da Back' (TLC - Hat To Da Back). Polo is a real old cheekbone, 'Polo' and 'Guess' are real 80s and this fashion is still there. Also in the middle of the cheekbones, it was very fashionable to wear 'Tommy Hilfiger' (Tommy Hilfiger) - it was 90x clothing. Everyone wore jeans, jackets, backpacks. If you did not wear 'Tommy', then you had 'Helly Hensen', 'Spider', ski clothes, huge jackets, this was not just a coat or a jacket, we dressed it in clubs . This whole style refers to the 'East Coast, New York' (East Coast, New York - East Coast) if you were so dressed immediately it was clear that you are from 'East Coast', because in the 'West Coast' (West Coast) - West Coast) dressed quite differently, they wore 'Cakis' (Cakis), 'Laps' (Laps) and so on, and this was the mainstream current in America at the time and everyone really wanted to be cool.

And with it, many people do not understand how could the music or was - a dance always goes with it, so much of the 'New School' came from the south, because there came the most popular music! Each region has its own music: in New York (New York), our hip-hop, in Atlanta (Atlanta) their sound (Sound) and they respectively are dancing to it, in Houston (Huston) their sound and dance with him, also San Francisco Bay Area in northern California (Bay Area).

In the central south, Los Angeles - 'Crump' (Krump), that dancing 'krampery' - they dance hip-hop!

prop.style.popping.history=History (70-80)
prop.style.popping.text2=The popping style (English "popping", but for the convenience of pronunciation in Russia, say popping) appeared in the late 70's in California. The ancestor of this style is a man named Sam Solomon (Sam Solomon), known to the world as Boogaloo Sam. Sam repeatedly saw the performances of the "The Lockers" team, which always aroused his great interest, and after another such performance, Sam had a desire to create something of his own, his own style, unlike anybody. He began to try to repeat the movements he saw, to invent his own, to connect them. The name for the style that turned out all this, Sam decided to take from the title of James Brown's song "Do The Boogaloo". So this style was called "Boogaloo". Soon after that, Sam came up with another style, dancing that he did muscle contractions at the end of each movement, and pronounced the word "pop" (pop). So behind this style the name "Popping" was fixed. Sam found and came up with new movements, copied already known to him and added "pop" to them, thereby increasingly developing the style base. Later, Solomon began to combine both styles - "Boogaloo" and "Popping" - in dance. Formation of a new generation of dancers. In 1977, in the city of Fresno (California), Boogaloo Sam decides to assemble his team of dancers, which he successfully achieves. So there are "The Electronic Boogaloo Lockers", which Sam named so, being in many respects impressed by, everyone known, "The Lockers". The structure of "The Electronic Boogaloo Lockers" includes:
prop.style.popping.text3=Each of the team members come up with some kind of their own style or element. That is popping enriched with various new style and sub-genres. In 1978, Sam moved to Long Beach (Longbeach) in California. There he decided to teach popping and boogaloo his younger brother, whose name was Timothy Solomon. Later Timothy became known to the world as Poppin Pete. He has brought to the development of popping a lot of what we know today. And to this day he invents and develops original popping and boogaloo base. Once, in the same 1978, he changed the composition of the team and its name. In fact, it was a new team and, as a result, generation of dancers. Sam called it "The Electric Boogaloos". The structure of The Electric Boogaloos included:
prop.style.popping.popularity=Growing popularity of style
prop.style.popping.text4=In the 80's popping won the masses and became very popular. Everyone danced it. All new teams were formed, tournaments were held. Popping went outside the US. People around the world tried to repeat unimaginable movements; move? Like a robot and start a wave all over the body. An important role played in this singer and dancer Michael Jackson (Michael Jackson), which was gaining then frenzied popularity and used in his videos and shows, many movements from popping. But this entailed some problems, the main one of which was that: "From lack of awareness of people in other countries, popping has been warped and changed beyond recognition." They did not know the exact names of movements, history, etc. So there was a certain style of "Electric Boogie" (Electric Boogie). Uninformed people called popping so much, using only the most vivid styles of it, such as Gliding, Waving, King Tut and Robot, without even knowing the existence of basic elements such as "Fresno" "," Oldman ", etc.
prop.style.popping.falling=Falling popularity of style

In the circle, in these competitions, representatives of loking and popping also began to leave. True, but mostly they were poppers, because locking, by that time, lost its relevance. So popping entrenched in the circles of the break dance dancers. Over time, generations of dancers changed. In the late 80's, popping was increasingly leaving, breaking and hip-hop came. Popping dancers have rarely been seen on TV, and the style has increasingly deepened into the scope of the break. Funk was out of fashion.

From the Spanish "rumba" translates as "way". The name truly conveys the whole meaning of the choreography. The path of the soul - what can characterize this dance more? In the early 30-ies rumba was a mixture of the main rumba with guarachi, Cuban balero and son.
